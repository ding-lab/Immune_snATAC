# SCENIC was run two times

* ```Run.v.20230912``` -- contains results of run with (+) only regulons.

* ```Run.v.20231027``` -- contains results of run with both (+) and (-) regulons

* In the second run, results of first step were used from the previous run here ../Run.v.20230912. Then the steps 2-3 were needed to be run with --all_modules parameter, and then the last step was needed to be run as usual.
